						Art Gallery is home to acclaimed artists such as Andrea
						Gustavino, Andy Warhol, Angelo Brescianini, Sheng Qi,

						Janice Mahlman to name a few. Among the landmark
						exhibitions of Aria Art Gallery were the Icastica during
						the first biennial of contemporary art at the Arezzo,
						National Museum of Medieval and Modern Art in 2013. Then
						in 2016, there was Perditiva which was a collaborative
						effort with the Design Biennale and the Cultural
						Department of Rimini. The gallery also collaborated with
						the Giorgio Baratti Antique Gallery for the exhibition
						entitled Timelessness which was presented in Florence
						and London. Timelessness was an exhibit which combined
						the iconic paintings of the 16th and 17th century with
						present day contemporary artworks. Address: Borgo
